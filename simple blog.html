 	   <span>Dal Lake</span> is a lake in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, India. The lake is connected to other lakes of the Kashmir Valley.The most popular time to visit Dal Lake is between June and August when the weather is probably at its most pleasant.Winter however has its own attractions and this is when the spectacular scenery can be experienced at its magnificent best. Winter temperatures average around 1 to 11 degrees Celsius but during a harsh winter, temperatures can drop as low as minus 11 degrees and at such temperatures, the surface of the lake can freeze. Needless to say, venturing onto the frozen surface can be extremely dangerous and should not be attempted without taking specialist advice from local experts.	   </p>

 	   <p>Amritsar is world-famous for the beautiful and highly revered Golden Temple or Sri Harmandir Sahib, which is one of the most prominent spiritual sites in the country. The temple is a two-storeyed structure with its top half covered in almost 400 kg of pure gold leaf, which is what earned it its English moniker. Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the leader of the Sikh empire, is believed to have initiated the construction in the 19th century. The rest of the temple complex is built in white marble, inlaid with precious and semi-precious colourful stones. To create motifs, the pietra dura technique has been used. The grand temple complex is awe-inspiring in its size.</p>
